___________ Challenge ___________ 

Using Terraform: 
	Create a new user: PoliciesExampleuser. 
	Attach an AWS-managed policy: ViewOnlyAccess (job). 
	Define an in-line policy: allow very action under S3 (all resources). 
	Attach this new policy to the user. 
Try to list all buckets as this new user before and after applying the policies. 


_ Solution _ 

* Created terraform.tf file with aws and pgp providers. 
* Created user_password.tf file with the user and its initial password. 
* terraform fmt, validate, init 
* Initial password (from terraform): c$zzn%[y06RL_bWV6raY 
* Generated new password from Random.org: mzLCqmbwSaf3NPLEC6RA 
	ERROR: User "PoliciesExample.User" cannot change their password: "Either user is not authorized to perform iam:ChangePassword or entered password does not comply with account password policy set by administrator." 
* Give this user iam:ChangePassword permission by attachin in-line policy: policies.tf, attach_policies_user.tf. 
* Logged on as PoliciesExample.User with initial password and was asked to change it. Updated to new password. 
* Confirmed user has no permissions. 
* Added ReadOnlyAccess policy and attached it to user. 	$ terraform apply 
* Confirmed user can now see the buckets. 
* Added PoliciesExampleUser-S3All attachment.
