___________ Challenge ___________ 

Using Terraform: 
	Create a bucket. 
	Upload a file to it. 

Now change the content of the file. Notice how terraform plan sees no S3 changes. 

Make Terraform track the contents of the file using its ETag. 


_ Solution _ 

* Configuration files: terraform.tf, track_s3_content.tf 
* Deploy resources: 						$ terraform validate, terraform plan, terraform apply 
* Display S3 object contents: 					$ aws s3 cp s3://$LATEST_BUCKET/hello.txt - && cat -
* As I am managing the local text file and its content also with Terraform, I need to run the apply twice: once for updating the local text file content, and the second time to update the etag (and the object itself too).
