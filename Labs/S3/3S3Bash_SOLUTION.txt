_____________________ Challenge _____________________ 
* Create bash scripts to do:
	(1) List buckets (name only), 
		Order by creation date (newest on top), 
		Only top 2 results (if there are more then "..."). 
	(2) Get newest bucket. 
	(3) Create bucket in region: us-east-2. 
		In SUC should say "Successfully created the new bucket in region $ ! " 
	(4) Upload file to bucket. 
	(5) Explore newest bucket (display contents). 
	(6) Explore a bucket (display only the object names). 
	(7) Delete bucket along with all its contents. 

_ Solution _

	(1): list_buckets.sh 
	(2): newest_bucket.sh 
	(3): create_bucket.sh 
	(4): upload_file.sh 
	(5): newest_bucket.sh 
	(6): display_bucket_contents.sh 
	(7): delete_bucket.sh 
		+ We need to create a json that contains the objects inside the bucket we want to delete. 
			- Get all objects: 					jq '.Contents' 
			- Get the keys: 					jq '.Contents[] | .Key' 
			- Array of strings (keys):				jq '[.Contents[] | .Key]' 
			- Call the array "Objects" (inside JSON object):		jq ' { Objects: [.Contents[] | .Key] } ' 
			- Promote array of strings called "Objects" to 
				array of objects with Key "AAA": values: 		jq ' { Objects: [.Contents[] | { AAA: .Key }] } ' 
			- Replace AAA with "Key": 				jq ' { Objects: [.Contents[] | { Key: .Key }] } '
