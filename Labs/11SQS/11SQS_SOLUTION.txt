Using Python SDK: 
	Create a Standard Queue (SQS). 
	Send some messages. 
	Recieve the messages. 
	Delete the messages (after receiving them). 

	Create a FIFO Queue (SQS). 
	Send some messages. 
	Recieve the messages. 
	Delete the messages (after receiving them). 

What is the difference between them?


_ Solution _ 

* Files: main.py. 

* The differences are that: 
	+ Standard:
		- Queue ocassionally seems empty. 
		- Messages arrive in random order. 
	+ FIFO: 
		- If there is at least one message, we always recieve it. 
		- Messages alwas arrive in order.
