Using Terraform: 
	Create an AWS Lambda function that: 
		Greets the user: "Welcome to the club, <TITLE>." 
		Where TITLE is appropiate for user's gender. 
		If user is 21 or older (but not too old). 
		Bundle the code in a Docker image. 


_ Solution _ 

* Files: terraform.tf, ecr_repo.tf, containerized_lambda.tf. 
* Only managing the ECR repo with Terraform. 
* Building and uploading the Docker image manually: 
	$ docker build -t lambda-python . 
	$ docker run -d -p 9000:8080 lambda-python:latest 
	$ curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{"payload": "hello"}' 
	$ docker stop e
	$ # Got get-login-password and docker login commands from ECR > Private repositories > lambdas-repo > View push commands. 
	$ # Tagged and pushed using commands from there. 
* Referencing the image URI in the tf. 
* Deleted images in repo manually. 
* $ terraform destroy
